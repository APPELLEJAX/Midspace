Jason~I'm the first person to post to Midspace!!!
Jake~What's this Midspace thing anyways? I've heard all my friends talking about it, but I'm not sure how to use it. Can someone help me figure it out?
Charlene~Midspace is a social media site developed by midshipmen, for midshipmen. It started as a project for IT350 to create a simple social media site. Now it has grown to become the most popular app within the brigade.
Jason~Yeah, I helped develop Midspace, so it's basically the greatest website out there.
Charlene~No duh, Jason. We all helped develop Midspace. In reality, we're the only ones using it yet. But soon....
Jake~Oh yeah! I thought I recognized the login screen! But where is A.J. in all this?
Jason~Where is AJ?
A.J.~Sorry guys, I'm right here. It took me a while.
